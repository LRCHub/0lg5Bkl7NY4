Hey
When the leaves start fallin',
I'll come callin'
I'll be right outside your door
Never do get borin',
Monday mornin's
With our clothes
all on the floor
Ain't seen you
since last October
And now we're both one year
older
When the leaves start fallin',
I'll come callin' aber
Let's take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
Hit or miss, I'll take the risk
'Cause I can take
another few years of this
So I won't break a promise
No matter how bad that I want it
Take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
Why we gotta get so serious?
Why we gotta get so serious?
Man, it's so frustratin',
don't mind waitin'
You're a girl worth waitin' for
If I stumble on a mountain,
I'll go 'round it
Till I'm right outside your door
Dip our toes into the water,
one more kiss will pour me under
Man, it's so frustratin',
don't mind waitin'
Let's take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
Hit or miss, I'll take the risk
'Cause I can take
another few years of this
So I won't break a promise
No matter how bad that I want it
Take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
Why we gotta get so serious?
Why we gotta get so serious?
So I won't break a promise (No)
No matter how bad that I want it
Take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
When the leaves start fallin',
I'll start callin'
I'll be right outside your door
Never do get borin',
Monday mornin'
With our clothes
all on the floor
Ain't seen you
since last October
And now
we're both one year older
When the leaves start fallin',
I'll come callin'
Let's take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
Hit or miss, I'll take the risk
'Cause I can take
another few years of this
So I won't break a promise
No matter how bad that I want it
Take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
(Why we gotta get so)
Why we gotta get so serious?
(Why we gotta get so)
(So serious)
Why we gotta get so serious?
So I won't break a promise
No matter how bad that I want it
Take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
(Gotta be so)
Take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
(Why we got to get so)
Hit or miss, I'll take the risk
'Cause I can take
another few years of this
So I won't break a promise
No matter how bad that I want it
Take our time with this,
I'm fine with this
Why we gotta get so serious?
