You said I picked up two girls from the bar
But you know it ain't true

And you know I'll do anything (anything)
That's why they hatin on me (hatin on me)

Y'all, all I get is
"Where you been?"
"What you got on?"
"Who you with? What you doing?"
"Who screwin'?"
Get off my ass
I kick it grown women style
You got the petty ways of a child
Caught you checking my draws, you fowl
Now everybody wanna be ghettofab, you better ask
Chris Tucker, Silkk the Shocker, Rass Kass
In the ghetto Gotham City
They saw me shakin my ass
Looking to face off with you true nigga style
Or the future will be the past
And it ain't gon last, what-what?
