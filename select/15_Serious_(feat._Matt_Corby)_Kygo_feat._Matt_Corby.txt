We are so serious
Letting the money take control
Of the love that we should know
The music's mysterious
Bringing together you and me
Taking in that frequency, yeah

Slow down pretending that you know
Where we're supposed to go through generations
Always getting told, don't question the control
Working on to buy a life before it's gone

We are too serious
We're letting the money take control
Of the love that's in our soul
And the music's mysterious
Bringing together you and me
Taking in that frequency, yeah

We are too serious
We're letting the money take control
Of the love that we should know
And the music's mysterious
Bringing together you and me
Taking in that frequency, yeah

Slow down pretending that you know
Where we're supposed to go through generations
Always getting told, don't question the control
Working on to buy a life before it's gone
